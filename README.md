DETAILS:

- Corridor planning often falls into the domain of multiobjective evaluation. MOGADOR is a multi-objective genentic algorithm for corridor location problems which produces a wide range of feasible corridor alternatives to help decision makers understand tradeoffs among competing objectives.
